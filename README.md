# audiblerabbit
Creates a WAV file that gives audible markers every 50 meters.  The WAV file can be converted to an MP3 using an encoder such as The LAME MP3 Encoder.

Arguments such as 25x1:15@400 can be given along with more complex arguments as noted in the CPP file.  In this example, the pace is 75 seconds (1:15) for every 400 meters with a count for each lap.
